# CNN
## Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Facial Recognition task.
## Dataset: Face Recognition Dataset on Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vasukipatel/face-recognition-dataset
You can use your own custom dataset
## Running
Run all code in the "Normal.ipynb" Jupiter Notebook. Custom change can be made, with the modification of these following files:
### 1. config.py
There are 2 variables to custom:
DIRPATH: Currently path to the dataset downloaded from Kaggle, to use your dataset, copy the path of the folder containing your own data.
INPUT_SIZE: the size to normalize all picture as input images. Change it purpose-accordingly
### 2. requirements.txt
Contains to required libraries to compile the programm. Add more libraries in this as personal need for the programm to download them.
